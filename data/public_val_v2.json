    "input": "dark matter plays an important role in the formation of structure in the universe . \n however , little is known about the nature of dark matter , but it has become clear that the simplest paradigm , that of collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) , can explain the observed structure in the universe quite well . \n numerical simulations , which provide a powerful way to study the formation of structure in the universe , indicate that cdm gives rise to a particular density profile ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; moore et al . \n 1999 ) . in these simulations \n , the nfw profile appears to be an excellent description of the radial mass distribution for halos with a wide range in mass . \n the density profile on small scales , however , remains controversial as other groups find different results ( e.g. , ghigna et al . 2000 ) . \n in addition , realistic simulations should include the effect of baryons , which complicate matters even further . on the other hand , \n there is good agreement for the density profile on large scales , and a comparison of the profiles of real objects with the predictions provides an important test of the assumption that structures form through dissipationless collapse . \n clusters of galaxies are particularly well suited for such a comparison , because their formation can be simulated fairly well . \n unfortunately , because clusters are dark matter dominated , it is difficult to measure the mass distribution at large radii from the cluster centre . \n dynamical estimators can be used , but assumptions have to be made about the shape of the cluster , its dynamical state , and the velocity anisotropies ( e.g. , van der marel et al . \n 2000 ) . \n a promising approach is that of weak gravitational lensing . \n the tidal gravitational field of the cluster distorts the images of distant background galaxies . \n this distortion can be measured and can be used to reconstru...",
    "output": "weak gravitational lensing provides a direct way to study the mass distribution of clusters of galaxies at large radii . \n unfortunately , large scale structure along the line of sight also contributes to the lensing signal , and consequently affects the measurements . \n we quantify the effect of distant uncorrelated large scale structure on the inferred mass profile of clusters as measured from weak lensing . \n we consider nfw profiles , and find that large scale structure is a major source of uncertainty for most practical situations , when a model , with the mass @xmath0 and the concentration parameter @xmath1 as free parameters , is fit to the observations . \n we find that the best constraints are found for clusters at intermediate redshifts @xmath2 . for a cluster at @xmath3 , \n optimal results are obtained when the lensing signal is measured out to @xmath4 arcminutes . \n measurements at larger radii do not improve the accuracy with which the profile can be determined , contrary to what is expected when the contribution from large scale structure is ignored . the true uncertainties in @xmath0 and the concentration parameter @xmath1 are @xmath5 times larger than when distant large scale structure is not included in the error budget . \n cosmology : gravitational lensing  galaxies : clusters"

    "input": "entanglement is emerging as an important characteristic of many - particle systems . while not yet a directly accessible quantity experimentally , entanglement entropy ( ee ) and spectrum have been studied theoretically and numerically in many different models . \n in general they are _ not _ simply related to correlation functions measured in linear response , and thus provide alternative probes of the system that are particularly useful in determining the nature of phases and phase transitions.@xcite    among the many systems whose entanglement properties have been studied , the best understood are perhaps one - dimensional ( 1d ) conformally - invariant systems . in this case \n it is not only understood that bipartite ee grows logarithmically with subsystem size with a coefficient depending on the central charge only,@xcite but also much is known about how a single impurity affects ee.@xcite the effect of the impurity depends sensitively on whether the perturbation it induces is relevant or not in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense . \n when it is relevant , it effectively cuts the chain into two decoupled pieces in the scaling limit , and typically produces a finite correction to entanglement entropy . on the other hand , \n when it is irrelevant , its effect goes to zero in a power - law fashion in the scaling limit.@xcite what has been left out in previous studies is the case when the impurity is _ \n exactly marginal_. this is the case when a single potential scatterer is embedded in a 1d free fermi gas,@xcite which is the subject of the present work . \n the non - interacting nature of the system allows for detailed numerical studies in sufficiently large systems sizes that yields results in the scaling regime . \n our main findings are the following . \n a single impurity in a 1d free fermion lattice induces two subleading contributions to ee , both of which scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the subsystem size . \n one of these contributions oscillates with ...",
    "output": "the one - dimensional free fermi gas is a prototype conformally invariant system , whose entanglement properties are well - understood . in this work , \n the effects of a single impurity on one dimensional free fermion entanglement entropy are studied both analytically and numerically . \n such an impurity represents an exactly marginal perturbation to the bulk conformally invariant fixed point . \n we find that the impurity leads to sub - leading contributions to the entanglement entropy that scale inversely with the subsystem size . \n the origin of such contributions are identified ."
