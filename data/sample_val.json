    "input": "Edge computing has emerged as a critical paradigm for deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments. By moving inference closer to data sources, edge deployment reduces latency and bandwidth requirements. However, it introduces challenges in model optimization, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to fit models within memory and compute constraints.",
    "output": "Edge computing enables ML deployment in resource-constrained settings by reducing latency through local inference, but requires model optimization techniques like quantization and pruning to meet hardware constraints."
